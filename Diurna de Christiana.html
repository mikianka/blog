                                    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">MANILA, Philippines</span> — An alleged rider of a popular food delivery service was arrested Wednesday morning for yielding shabu or crystal meth in Sta. Cruz, Manila, police said.

                                    A Manila Police District (MPD) report identified the suspect as Eduardo Delos Santos, 48. He was allegedly captured red-handed during a supposed drug transaction at the corner of Yuseco and Oroquieta Streets, according to police.  
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    Sunt in culpa The police report said the suspect was arrested after a concerned citizen called 911 to report an alleged drug transaction going on in the area. MPD operatives subsequently sent a team to verify the report.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    Police said the team validated the information and saw the rider transacting with an unidentified man.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    “After confirming that the said suspects were involved in an illegal drug transaction, the arresting officers rushed towards the said suspects and a brief chase ensued that resulted in his apprehension and recovery of the evidence,” the MPD said in its report.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    The unidentified man, however, managed to escape, the MPD report added.

                                    <p>
                                    Police said they seized from Delos Santos three grams of suspected shabu with an estimated value of P20,400 and a Yamaha Mio Soul, among others.

                                    Police said the suspect will face charges in violation of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

                                     is the fastest-growing internet economy in Southeast Asia fueled by e-commerce and food delivery services, according to a report by Google, Temasek, and Bain & Co.

                                    The e-Conomy Southeast Asia Report released on Wednesday showed the Philippines’ overall internet economy in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) will likely reach $40 billion in value by 2025 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    “Overall, the Philippines was the fastest- growing market in the region, driven by strict lockdowns as well as a tipping point on the adoption of certain digital services,” the report read.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    The Philippines’ GMV is estimated to reach $17 billion this year, an increase of 93% from a year ago, due to government initiatives and mass digital adoption. This strong growth has also been fueled by double-digit growth in sectors such as food delivery services.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    The Philippines also added 12 million new digital consumers since the pandemic started in March 2020. Of this, 63% are from non-metro areas. Majority also said they plan to continue using these services even after the pandemic.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    “Pre-pandemic users — those who used the services before the pandemic — have consumed an average of 4.3 more services since the pandemic began and 95% of pandemic consumers are still consumers today. Despite rapid growth in the last 18 months, there remains significant headroom since the Philippines has the lowest digital consumer penetration in the region, with only 68% of internet users consuming online services,” the report said.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    The report showed that 39% of digital merchants in the Philippines said they would not have survived the pandemic, if not for digital platforms.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    “The digital adoption we’ve seen in the Philippines since last year has contributed to the accelerated growth of the country’s internet economy, magnifying its vast potential,” Google Philippines Country Director Bernadette Nacario said in a statement.

                                    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">By Andrew J. Marasigan,</span> The restaurant industry is among the most affected sectors in this pandemic. Not only have the lockdowns curtailed dine-in sales, the fear of infection continues to discourage millions from going out and patronizing their favorite restaurants.</p>

                                    <p>According to the European Journal of Social Psychology, it takes 66 days for behaviors to become a habit. Living under the COVID regime for 20 months has left consumers with the habit of consuming restaurant food at home via delivery service. Eating at home is now ingrained in our DNA and home delivery will comprise the bulk of restaurant sales as we move forward. Thus, it is imperative that restaurants have a delivery mechanism and online ordering platform to thrive.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Although there will always be a space for experiential dining within the confines of a restaurants, it will no longer be the principal source of sales for most establishments. Those with enormous dining rooms will have to downsize. Studies further show that for the majority of restaurant types, it is more advantageous to have smaller but more plentiful restaurants in areas where people live and work (for ease in food delivery) rather than bigger restaurants in expensive commercial centers.</p>

                                    <p>With rapidly evolving market conditions, it is important for industry players to understand the emerging trends. As an industry insider, I was fortunate to secure a copy of the Food Trends Report commissioned by a regional (ASEAN) food delivery portal. Let me share the pertinent findings that relate to the Philippine market. </p>

                                    <p>The food delivery sector clocked-in gross revenues of P55 billion last year. One third of all meals consumed by Filipinos were ordered from restaurants while two-thirds were home cooked. Fifty percent of customers decide what they want to eat based on what they see on the app. No surprise, subscriptions to food delivery aggregators, like Grab Food and Food Panda, increased by a whopping 61% over the last year. There is no escaping it — restaurants need to be visible in food aggregator apps given their household penetration.</p>

                                    <p>The downside, however, is that food delivery aggregators take a percentage of sales, sometimes as high as 25%. This is the price restaurants pay for being included in the app and for the logistics services provided. Whereas in the pre-COVID years, the malls were those taking a percentage of sales from restaurant operators, today, it is the delivery aggregators. Restaurant operators will be hard-pressed to survive if they have to pay both. To maintain profit margins, it should be one or the other.</p>

                                    <p>Families with children are the principal patrons of home delivery services. Statistics show that 52% of patrons are married with kids, with an average household size of 4.5 people. Sixty five percent of those booking the order are between 25 to 44 years old. As of last year, 78% ordered food for the family and not just themselves.</p>

                                    <p>The top three reasons for patronizing a restaurant are: first, to satisfy cravings for food that cannot be cooked at home; second, for lack of time to cook; and third, for convenience. It is easier to eat at home than having to deal with traffic and/or parking.</p>

                                    <p> Lunch is the biggest market for food delivery, followed by dinner and afternoon snacks. Breakfast and midnight snacks are the timeslots that generate the least orders. The top 10 food items sought after or searched for by Filipinos are the following (not in order): pizza, doughnuts, milk tea, cakes, burgers, bakery items, Chinese food, coffee, Filipino food, and fried chicken. Interestingly, cake sales are expanding the fastest, having grown 260% between 2019 and 2020. </p>

                                    <p> Eating healthily is now a growing trend among Filipino consumers. Three in four Filipinos claim they want to eat in a healthy manner, 60% of whom say they are even willing to pay a premium for a healthy meal. Orders from restaurants that offer healthy options have increased by 400% last year. Trending are salads, the use of organic ingredients, immunity boosters, those with less salt or sugar, and those with less oil and/or calories. So strong is the healthy trend that many restaurants are now tweaking their menus to include healthy options. </p>

                                    <p> Also high on the search list are food items that are “old favorites” but difficult to prepare at home. This includes dishes like pizza and pasta for the Italian category, specialty dimsum and hot viands for Chinese, kare-kare, lengua estofado, and crispy pata for Filipino, and cakes and pastries for dessert. </p>

                                    <p> Data shows that Filipino families patronize an average of 2.5 restaurants brands per month. The reasons that drive patronage are: variety of choice 71%; value for money 54%; perks and promotions 48%; and visual appeal of the menu 43%. </p>

                                    <p> It is recommended that restaurants pack their menu with low-cost dishes as these encourage consumers to order multiple items, thus, driving up the total bill. A low-cost item is anything below P150. The caveat, however, is that consumers prefer short menus, rather than kilometric selections. </p>

                                    <p> As far as promotions are concerned, 82% of Filipinos prefer buy-one take-one, 82% like free delivery charge, and 69% product discount. Bundling with drinks, desserts, or side dishes have proven to be effective too. </p>

                                    <p> Consumers are spoiled. Studies show that establishments with a customer feedback score lower than 4.8 rating (out of five) are not considered prime choices. And should a restaurant fumble an order or deliver food that is below quality expectations, the probability of them losing the customer permanently is 70%. </p>

                                    <p> Delivery is now the name of the game as far as food service goes in the Philippines. Restaurant operators who excel in this segment stand to reap rich rewards. </p>
